The first phase of the project consists of building the entire database side of the project including interfaces and test cases. 
Forward thinking is strongly encouraged. Questions such as: What are we storing? How are we accessing it? What are we calculating?
All should be addressed during this stage. Project 3 was an example of a database. HW10 covers techniques on how to make the 
database thread safe. Remember the database will only be interacting with a single server; however, that server will be 
interacting with multiple clients simultaneously. A README.txt file is required with each phase and should be submitted in 
the Vocareum workspace alongside any java files. See documentation bellow.
